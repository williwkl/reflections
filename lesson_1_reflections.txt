How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    was easily identified

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    see the progress and allow to go back to words you might have deleted

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Only I know when a feature is completed and then I can make the commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    When file are interconnected and changes in one file need to have additions in a second one

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    simply show the commits done and showing the differences between two adjacent commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    In case off errors I can go back to look where it was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Website development
